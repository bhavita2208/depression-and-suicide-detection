Tracing is expensive and the excessive number of tracings could be due to (1) creating @tf.function repeatedly in a loop, (2) passing tensors with different shapes, (3) passing Python objects instead of tensors. For (1), please define your @tf.function outside of the loop. For (2), @tf.function has reduce_retracing=True option that can avoid unnecessary retracing. For (3), please refer to https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/function#controlling_retracing and https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/function for  more details.\n","1/1 [==============================] - 0s 56ms/step\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n","2023-02-21 15:41:34.657 6 out of the last 6 calls to \u003cfunction Model.make_predict_function.\u003clocals\u003e.predict_function at 0x7f64f014c310\u003e triggered tf.function retracing.
